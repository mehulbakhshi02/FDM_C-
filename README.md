# OOP_Practice
The repository contains codes that I wrote while practicing OOP. Following are the description along with some results of different files.

## FDM.cpp
The code solves the ODE dn/dt=-an analytically and using Finite Difference Method (central differencing). It also calculates the absolute error between the two.

## 1DHT.cpp
The code determines steady state temperature distribution in a fin as shown in below.

The code uses FDM with Drichelt and Neumann Boundary Conditions at the two ends.
